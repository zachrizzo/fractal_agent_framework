      "content": "It seems like you might be asking how to switch Firebase projects. If you're using Firebase through the command line interface (CLI), you can switch between different Firebase projects using the `use` command. Here is a simple example:\n\n```bash\nfirebase use --add\n```\n\nThis command will prompt you to select the Firebase project you want to add to your Firebase CLI and assign it an alias. Once you've done that, you can switch to this project anytime using the following command:\n\n```bash\nfirebase use <alias>\n```\n\nReplace `<alias>` with the alias of the Firebase project you want to switch to.\n\nRemember, the Firebase CLI needs to be logged in to the correct Google account in order to access and switch between Firebase projects. You can log out of the current account using `firebase logout` and log into another account using `firebase login`. These commands will guide you through the process.",
